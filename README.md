# medium-blog-pasteable
### Should be able to be pasted into any site's HTML and will embed the blog found in rssFeedUrl
*currently to be used in a Carrd.co page*
As of 5/17/2023:
Works with CORS "disabled". 
TODO:
1. Functionality (due to current CORS error, info does not come back)
    * Either find a proxy host to first make request to Medium and then serve to client OR
    * use RSS to JSON online service (seems easier)
2. The look
    * Make buttons clickable
    * Some sort of way to inherit Carrd.co theme (at least main colours)
